        We wrote most of these websites with input from a talented team of
        dedicated pros in Corporate America. Each website is carefully crafted
        to reach a certain audience, pique their interest, and drive them to
        action.

        It’s a lot easier to make high-quality video content when you’ve got a
        world-class team of marketing professionals at your disposal.


        While many of these videos were created with an in-house team of talented creatives at a local startup, they reflect the Magic Pie craft of scriptwriting and voice-over work.


        Get to know a brand, its products, or its corporate culture in these videos produced by the brain trust at Magic Pie Copy.
