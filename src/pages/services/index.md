        Whether you're starting up or starting over, building your website has
        never been easier. As your freelance copywriter, I'll work with you to: 


        1. Identify the purpose of your website

        2. Pinpoint your target audience(s)

        3. Define your brand voice

        4. Design information architecture

        5. Write fresh copy for every page


        Throughout the process, I'll introduce you to my web design and development partners. Together, we'll customize a website that invites, engages, and inspires your audience.

      serviceTitle: Blogs & Articles
      serviceSubtitle: >-
        This isn't the coolest sentence I've ever typed, but I've written well
        over a hundred blogs. For a bunch of businesses in a lot of different
        industries, too. 


        But why does a business need a blog? In most cases, to accomplish at least one of five goals:


        1. Establish employees as thought leaders

        2. Offer insights or advice to customers

        3. Promote products or services

        4. Share company news

        5. Celebrate company culture


        So when people visit your website, they won't just learn more about your brand—they'll have no choice but to fall in love with it.

      serviceTitle: Print Collateral
      serviceSubtitle: >-
        Who says print is dead? 


        When you sit down with customers or talk to people at trade shows, you've got to leave something behind.  Something to touch. Something to read. Something to experience.


        With high-quality print materials, your products pop off the page. Your story is sensational. Your business? It's unbeatable! 


        With well-written (and beautifully designed) print collateral, you can attract, captivate, and activate your audience.

      serviceTitle: Video Scripts
      serviceSubtitle: >-
        What's your team look like right now? Understaffed and overworked? Burnt
        out? Up against a hard-and-fast deadline that's creeping ever closer?


        I get it. I've been there. I know how it feels.


        Which is why I understand how nice it can be to pass off a project—such as writing a video script—to someone who can look at it from a fresh perspective. Someone who can take your concept, run with it, and bring it to life. Someone like me.
