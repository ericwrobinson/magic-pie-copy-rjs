        Whether you're starting up or starting over, building your new website
        has never been easier. As your freelance copywriter, I'll work with you
        to: 


        1. Outline a site structure

        2. Define your brand voice

        3. Write fresh copy for every page


        Throughout the process, I'll introduce you to my web design and development partners. These guys—they're wizards. Together, we'll customize a website that invites, engages, and inspires your audience.

      serviceTitle: Blogs & Articles
      serviceSubtitle: >-
        This isn't the coolest sentence I've ever typed, but I've written well
        over a hundred blogs. For a bunch of businesses in a lot of different
        industries, too. 


        But why does a business need a blog? In most cases, to accomplish at least one of five goals:


        1. Establish employees as thought leaders

        2. Offer insights or advice to customers

        3. Promote products or services

        4. Share company news

        5. Celebrate company culture


        So when people visit your website, they won't just learn about your brand—they'll fall in love with it.

      serviceTitle: Print Collateral
      serviceSubtitle: >-
        Who says print is dead? 


        When you sit down with customers or talk to people at trade shows, you've got to leave something behind. Something memorable. Something to touch. To read. To experience. Same thing goes for your storefront, your food truck, or even your e-commerce business. 


        With high-quality print materials, your products pop off the page. Your story is sensational. Your brand? It's unbeatable! 


        With well-written (and beautifully designed) print collateral, you can attract, captivate, and activate your audience. Sound good? Let's do it.

      serviceTitle: Video Scripts
      serviceSubtitle: >-
        You work in marketing? What's your team look like? Understaffed and
        overworked? Burned out? Up against a hard-and-fast deadline that's
        creeping ever closer?


        I get it. I've been there. I know how it feels.


        Which is why I understand how nice it can be to pass off a project—such as writing a video script—to someone who can look at it from a fresh perspective. Someone who can take it, run with it, and bring it to life. Someone like me.


        If you're looking for a strong script that'll wow your team and entice your audience, I'm your guy.
