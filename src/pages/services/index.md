        Whether you're starting up or starting over, building your new website
        has never been easier. 


        As your freelance copywriter, I'll work with you to: 


        1. Outline a site structure

        2. Define your brand voice

        3. Write fresh copy for every page


        Throughout the process, I'll introduce you to my web design and development partners. These guys—they're wizards. Together, we'll customize a website that invites, engages, and inspires your audience.

      serviceTitle: Blogs & Articles
      serviceSubtitle: >-
        I must have written more than a hundred blogs. For a lot of different
        businesses in a lot of different industries, too.


        Education. Technology. Education technology. Startups. Small businesses. Manufacturing. Health. Fitness. Art. Accounting. Assisted living.  Marketing. Hiring. Firing. Cats. Dogs. Diversity. Fantasy football. Food. Booze. Buffalo. BBQ...


        The list goes on and on. 


        But why do businesses need blogs? For at least three reasons:


        1. To establish employees as thought leaders

        2. To promote products or services

        3. To celebrate company culture


        So when people visit your website, they can learn more about your brand, and–more to the point–fall in love with it. 


        Put simply, the best blogs win customers and influence them.

      serviceTitle: Print Collateral
      serviceSubtitle: >-
        Who says print is dead? When you sit down with customers or talk to
        people at trade shows, you've got to leave something behind. Something
        memorable. To touch. To read. To experience. Same thing goes for your
        storefront, food truck, or pizza place. 


        With high-quality print materials, your products pop off the page. Your mission is undeniable. Your brand? It's unbeatable! With well-written, beautifully designed print collateral, you can attract, engage, and activate your audience. 


        But it must be carefully calculated. Every word counts. And, of course, it all starts with your copy.

      serviceTitle: Video Scripts
      serviceSubtitle: >
        It’s a lot easier to make high-quality video content when you’ve got a
        world-class team of marketing professionals at your disposal.


        While many of these videos were created with an in-house team of talented creatives at a local startup, they reflect the Magic Pie craft of scriptwriting and voice-over work.
