        Whether you're starting up or starting over, building your new website
        has never been easier. 


        As your freelance copywriter, I'll work with you to: 


        1. Sketch a site structure

        2. Define your brand voice

        3. Write fresh copy for every page


        Throughout the process, I'll introduce you to my web design and development partners. These guys—they're wizards. Together, we'll customize a website that invites, engages, and inspires your audience.

      serviceTitle: Blogs & Articles
      serviceSubtitle: >-
        I've written well over a hundred blogs. For a lot of different
        businesses in a lot of different industries, too.


        Education. Technology. Education technology. Startups. Small businesses. Manufacturing. Health. Fitness. Skin care. Art. Accounting. Assisted living.  Marketing. Hiring. Firing. Cats. Dogs. Diversity. Fantasy football. Food. Booze. Buffalo. BBQ...


        The list goes on and on. 


        But why do businesses need blogs? For at least three reasons:


        1. To establish employees as thought leaders

        2. To promote products or services

        3. To celebrate company culture


        So when people visit your website, they can learn more about your brand, and–more to the point–fall in love with it. 


        Put simply, the best blogs win customers and influence them.

        I work with business owners, key stakeholders, and other marketers to
        share ideas and execute strategies. Through close collaborations, we
        create next-level content for corporate websites, videos, blogs, and
        more.

        It’s a lot easier to make high-quality video content when you’ve got a
        world-class team of marketing professionals at your disposal.


        While many of these videos were created with an in-house team of talented creatives at a local startup, they reflect the Magic Pie craft of scriptwriting and voice-over work.


        Get to know a brand, its products, or its corporate culture in these videos produced by the brain trust at Magic Pie Copy.
