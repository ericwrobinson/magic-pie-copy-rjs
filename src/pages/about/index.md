  subtitle: Magic Pie Copywriting is really just me, James. I've been a
    professional copywriter since 2012, and now that the gig economy is in full
    swing, I'm taking my talents to the streets.

  title: What have I done?
  subtitle: >-
    I've earned two degrees in English education. 

    I've taught. I've learned. I've failed.


    I've slung suds and served wings. 

    I've washed dishes. 

    I've mopped floors and bummed smokes out back.


    Then, finally, a full-time writing job. Then another. And then another.


    Ten years later, I'm still here. I'm still writing.


    As a freelancer, I've written copy for clients in Amarillo, Buffalo, and Chicago. B2B. B2C. Websites. Videos. All sorts of stuff. I love it. Will you?


    There's only one way to find out.
