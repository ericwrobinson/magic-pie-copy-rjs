intro:
  title: What have I done?
  subtitle: >-
    I've earned two degrees in English education. 

    I've taught. I've learned. I've failed.


    I've slung suds and served wings. 

    I've washed dishes. 

    I've mopped floors and bummed smokes out back.


    Then, finally, a full-time writing job. Then another. And then another.


    Ten years later, I'm still here. I'm still writing.


    As a freelance copywriter, I've written copy for clients in Amarillo, Buffalo, and Chicago. B2B. B2C. Websites. Videos. All sorts of stuff. 


    I love it. Will you?


    There's only one way to find out.
