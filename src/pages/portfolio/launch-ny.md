## I'd never worked on a website as a freelancer before, so this was kind of a big deal.

Sure, I'd written a handful of websites in [full-time writing positions](https://www.linkedin.com/in/james-a-colombo/) before... And I'd written a [freelance article or two](https://risecollaborative.com/?post_type=post&s=james+colombo&submit=submit)... But this was my first BIG opportunity. 

Fortunately, I'd be working with two old co-workers from my days at a startup called [Bak USA](https://magicpiecopy.com/portfolio/bak-usa/):

1. [Eric](https://thumbsupstudio.com/), a web designer
2. [Mike](https://michaelsmealstudios.com/), a web developer

We worked on a ton of cool stuff together. But anyway, a couple years later, we got this message from *another* friendly face from Bak USA: Celine, a marketing director at [Launch NY](https://launchny.org/). 

Celine came to us and was like, "Yo, I work at this place called Launch NY. We deal with startups and we need a new website. Are you interested?!"

We were like, "Hell yeah!" So we submitted a proposal to build it. And we won.

Did we get the gig because we low-balled the bejesus out of the competition? Almost certainly. But we didn't care. We wanted the job. This was our moment. 

### **So here's what we did.** We...

* Worked directly with: the president & CEO ([Marnie LaVigne, PhD](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marnie-lavigne-ph-d-9a74b35)) and the director of marketing at the time (our girl, [Celine Krzan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/celinekrzan))
* Agreed that the new Launch NY site would get a brand-new, modern look
* [Rebuilt the entire website ](https://thumbsupstudio.com/work/launchny/)from top to bottom:

  * New site architecture
  * New graphic design
  * New copy with branding guide
  * New web development
* Enhanced the aesthetics, tone, and mood of the website
* Developed three distinct pathways for the company's three specific users:

  * Entrepreneurs
  * Investors
  * Supporters
* Created 25 all-new webpages and relocated them from an outdated CMS to WordPress, the world's most popular website management platform
* Offered WordPress training to key stakeholders who could update the website with ease moving forward

### **You have to see it to believe it.**

Who doesn't love a good before-and-after photo? Compare and contrast the old website with the new to see how we executed the transformation **[here](https://thumbsupstudio.com/work/launchny/)**.
