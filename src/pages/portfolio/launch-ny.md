## I'd never worked on a website as a freelancer before, so this was kind of a big deal.

Sure, I'd written a handful of websites in full-time writing positions before... And I had written a freelance article or two... But this was my first BIG opportunity. 

Fortunately, I'd be working with two dudes I've worked with before: a web designer, Eric, and a web developer, Mike. I still work with them, actually. They're my current freelance partners. 

Anyway, we had previous experience building all sorts of killer web content for a startup called Bak USA. That place eventually flamed out hard, but that's not the point. A couple years later, this super cool girl who used to intern there, Celine, came to us and was like, "Yo, I just got this new job at a place called Launch NY. We deal with startups and we need a new website. Are you interested?!"

We were like, "Hell yeah!" So we submitted a proposal to build it. And we won.

Did we get the gig because we low-balled the living shit of the competition? Almost certainly. But we didn't care. We wanted the job. This was our moment. 

### **So here's what we did.** We...

* Worked directly with the president & CEO (Marnie LaVigne, PhD) and the director of marketing (our girl, Celine Krzan)
* Agreed that the new Launch NY site would get a brand-new, modern look
* Rehauled the entire website from top to bottom:

  * New site architecture
  * New graphic design
  * New copy with branding guide
  * New web development
* Enhanced the aesthetics, tone, and mood of the website
* Developed three distinct pathways for the company's three specific users:

  * Entrepreneurs
  * Investors
  * Supporters
* Created 25 all-new webpages and relocated them from an outdated CMS to WordPress, the world's most popular website management platform
* Offered WordPress training to key stakeholders who could update the website with ease moving forward

### **You have to see it to believe it.**

Who doesn't love a good before-and-after photo? Compare and contrast the old website with the new to see how we executed the transformation here.
