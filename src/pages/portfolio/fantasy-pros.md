Remember 2020? How could we forget, right?

When the pandemic popped up, I needed to exercise an itch to write, more-so than usual. And because I'm somewhat of a fantasy football fanatic, I thought I'd take a shot and see if I could write some articles for FantasyPros. 

So I sent an email to the head content guy over there. I told him I was really good at fantasy football. I even showed him my virtual trophy case on Yahoo Sports, along with some writing samples, of course. 

He liked it, so he hired me. I was added to the FantasyPros writers email chain and Slack channel, given access to WordPress, and given regular assignments. By the summertime, I was invited to write a weekly column called "Heat Index," in which I evaluated several low-key player's performance and helped readers decide whether to roster him on their fantasy teams. 

It was fun. I got to crack open some cold ones and write about a subject I was both knowledgable in and passionate about. But it was also grueling. And as soon as fantasy football became work, it became less fun. I served as a FantasyPros staffer for a year, though, and quietly dipped out. 

These days, I've got other fantasies to fantasize about.
