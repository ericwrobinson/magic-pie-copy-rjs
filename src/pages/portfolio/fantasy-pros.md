### Remember 2020? How could we forget, right?

When the pandemic hit home that March, I needed to scratch my itch to write—more-so than usual. And because I'm somewhat of a fantasy football fanatic, **I thought I'd take a shot and see if I could write some articles for FantasyPros.** 

So I sent an email to the head content guy over there. I told him I was really good at fantasy football. I even showed him my virtual trophy case on Yahoo Sports, along with some writing samples, of course. 

**He liked it, so he hired me.** 

I was added to the FantasyPros writers email chain and Slack channel, granted access to the company's WordPress account, and given regular assignments. By the summertime, I was invited to write a weekly column called "Heat Index." **In each article, I graded NFL players who were coming off of surprise fantasy performances from the week before.** It was my job to help readers determine whether to roster these players on their fantasy football teams moving forward. 

It was fun. **I got to crack open some cold ones and write about a subject I was both knowledgable in and passionate about.** But it was also grueling. And as soon as fantasy football became work, it became less fun. I served as a FantasyPros featured writer for a year and then quietly dipped out. 

All in all, **I contributed to 46 articles at FantasyPros**, some of which you're encouraged to explore here. Thanks for reading.
