## When the pandemic hit home in March 2020, I needed to scratch the itch to write—more-so than usual.

And because I'm somewhat of a fantasy football fanatic, **I thought I'd take a shot and see if I could write some articles for FantasyPros.** 

So I sent an email to the head content guy over there. I told him I was really good at fantasy football. I even showed him my virtual trophy case on Yahoo Sports (along with some writing samples, of course). 

**He liked it, so he hired me.**

I was added to the FantasyPros writers email chain and Slack channel, given access to the company's WordPress account, and asked to contribute a fresh article every week.

By the summertime, I was invited to write a recurring column called "Heat Index." This article would appear prominently on the FantasyPros homepage every week for the entire fantasy football regular season (15 weeks). My own column! I didn't jump at the opportunity. I *hurdled*. 

**In each article, I graded NFL players who were coming off of surprise fantasy performances from the week before.** It was my job to help readers determine whether to roster these players on their fantasy football teams moving forward. 

It was fun. **I got to crack open some cold ones and write about a subject I was both knowledgable in and passionate about.** But it was also grueling. And as soon as fantasy football became work, it became less fun. I served as a FantasyPros featured writer for one year—met all of my obligations—and then quietly dipped out. 

All in all, **I contributed to 46 articles at FantasyPros**, which you're encouraged to explore on my FantasyPros profile page. Thanks for reading.
