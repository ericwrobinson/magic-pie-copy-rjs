Remember 2020? How could we forget, right?

When the pandemic popped up, I needed to scratch my itch to write, more-so than usual. And because I'm somewhat of a fantasy football fanatic, I thought I'd take a shot and see if I could write some articles for FantasyPros. 

So I sent an email to the head content guy over there. I told him I was really good at fantasy football. I even showed him my virtual trophy case on Yahoo Sports, along with some writing samples, of course. 

He liked it, so he hired me. 

I was quickly added to the FantasyPros writers email chain and Slack channel, granted access to the company's WordPress account, and given regular assignments. By the summertime, I was invited to write a weekly column called "Heat Index," in which I evaluated the performance of football players who were coming off of surprise performances. It was my job to help readers determine whether to roster these players on their fantasy teams moving forward. 

It was fun. I got to crack open some cold ones and write about a subject I was both knowledgable in and passionate about. But it was also grueling. And as soon as fantasy football became work, it became less fun. I served as a FantasyPros featured writer for a year and then quietly dipped out. 

All in all, I contributed to 46 articles at FantasyPros, some of which you're encouraged to explore here.
