# I was sitting alone in a stranger's apartment when the email came through.

It was October 2020. I had just come home from an overnight golf outing with the guys. Had I been exposed to COVID? There was no way to know. Did my girlfriend make me quarantine for a week at an Airbnb in South Buffalo until I tested negative? You bet she did.

So there I was—shacked up with a case of beer and an extra large pizza—when I got a notification from Maura Devlin, the VP of marketing strategy from 43North.

**"I was wondering if you wanted to help us write a script,"** she said. "We need to make a video for this campaign we're running for Erie County's 'Back to Business' Grant Program. I remember collaborating with you when you were writing for Superior Jobs and Viaduct, and I really liked your stuff. Are you available?"

"Yeah, sure, I'm down!" I replied.

"Cool. **The idea is to encourage small business owners to apply for business grants from Erie County.** They need assistance during the pandemic, so this will help them get ready to open back up," she explained. "We need a quick turn-around on this thing. **Could you have something for us to look at tomorrow?**

"Yep, no problem."

And that was pretty much that.

Maura hooked me up with some notes right away.

**I drank my beer, ate my pizza, and cranked out a script that night.**

A quick back and forth the next day, maybe a second exchange after that, and boom—we were done.

A week or two later, the video (made in partnership with Lemur Studios) was up and running. For the next few weeks that followed, it was played prominently on social media platforms, targeted YouTube ads, and local news channels.

Was the video a success? I don't know. I think so. At the very least, it played a small role in helping 1,399 small businesses in Erie County receive $19.2 million in funding. And, well, that's something, right?
