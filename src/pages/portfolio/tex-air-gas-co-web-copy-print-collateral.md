# "You wanna write this website?"

My dude Bertholt, a master of graphic design, asked me if I wanted to team up on a new website project. 

Now, I love writing copy for websites. *Love it*. It's my favorite. 

And since this website project would involve working with our good friend and partner, Eric, I was like, "Oh, yeah, let's do this."

And that's when I was introduced to Jim and Joe Prowell, the father-son leadership team behind Tex-Air Gas Go. These guys—these true Texas gentlemen—represent a long legacy of fueling innovation in their industry. More than that, they're just super nice guys. 

Over a series of virtual meetings in 2020, we got together to discuss what their all-new website should look like, how it should sound, and why people should visit it. 

## From a copywriting perspective, our goals were to:

<br>

#### Highlight key differentiators

* Strong supply
* Transparent pricing
* Rapid response

<br>

#### Celebrate the founders and the legacy they've built

* Third-generation
* Veteran-owned
* Family business

<br>

#### Showcase high-profile customers

* Red Bull
* David Blaine

<br>

#### Illustrate a rich history of industry service and innovation

* Create a timeline
* Demonstrate growth
* Present a vision for the future

<br>

**Here's another thing:** Them Prowell boys're good ol' fashioned Texas businessmen. Kind and courteous. Straight to the point. Super funny and charming as hell. The copy needed to paint a picture of these guys and their business in a way that would balance their prowess with humility, their innovative spirit with an old-fashioned work ethic.
